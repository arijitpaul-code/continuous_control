Project Details

The project is to train an agent to maintain the position of a double-jointed arm at the target location for as many time steps as possible, in Unity Reacher environment. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The environment is considered solved when the agent get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes, for the single arm agent version of the environment. For the multi-arm (20) version of the environment, the agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).

Getting Started
